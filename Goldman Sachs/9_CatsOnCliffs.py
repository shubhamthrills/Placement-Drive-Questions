9_Cats on cliffs

On a cliff of length 110m at a height 240m, 10 cats are positioned facing either the left or right direction arbitrarily. The length of the cliff is large compared to the size of each cat. Initially, all cats start running in the direction they are facing at a speed 12m/sec. Whenever any cat collides with another cat, both the cats instantly reverse their respective directions and continue running. When a cat reaches the ends of the cliff, it falls down.
